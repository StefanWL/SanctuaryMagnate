This is a simple game written inside of a MySQL database.
Scripts for simulating visitors, zoo operations, user controls and enforcing rules are written using MySQL procedures.
A simple terminal for user input was created using PHP to connect to the database, query for data to display on page.
The user also is able to send commands, also using PHP.
Commands sent by the user are validated and sanitized both server side and client side to make sure they are not harmful and function properly.
